  Forecasting Revenue Change Query (Q6) 

  This query quantifies the amount of revenue increase that would have resulted
  from eliminating certain companywide discounts in a given percentage range in
  a given year. Asking this type of "what if" query can be used to look

  for ways to increase revenues.



  Business Question

  The Forecasting Revenue Change Query considers all the lineitems shipped in a
  given year with discounts between DISCOUNT-0.01 and DISCOUNT+0.01. The query
  lists the amount by which the total revenue would have increased if these
  discounts had been eliminated for lineitems with l_quantity less than
  quantity. Note that the potential revenue increase is equal to the sum of
  [l_extendedprice * l_discount] for all lineitems with discounts and quantities
  in the qualifying range.
