  Parts/Supplier Relationship Query (Q16)

  This query finds out how many suppliers can supply parts with given
  attributes. It might be used, for example, to

  determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily
  ordered parts.


  Business Question

  The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can
  supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements. The customer
  is interested in parts of eight different sizes as long as they are not of a
  given type, not of a given brand, and not from a supplier who has had
  complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented
  in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.
