  Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query (Q12)

  This query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is
  negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be
  received by customers after the committed date.


  Business Question

  The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode, for
  lineitems actually received by customers in a given year, the number of
  lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the
  l_commitdate for

  two different specified ship modes. Only lineitems that were actually shipped
  before the l_commitdate are considered. The late lineitems are partitioned
  into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a

  priority other than URGENT or HIGH.
